Part B:
At the chosen maximal radius of 8 Bohr radii, we find the lowest energy to be -0.499975102444506
As can be seen in B.svg, the solutions start to diverge close to the maximal R_max

Part C:
A comparison of how the lowest energy approaches the exact result (-1/2) for the simple and improved conditions
 It is evident that the improved condition converges on much smaller R_max.
