Q3:
1. What is the mcs option to turn off all warnings?
mcs -warn:x
x in [0,1,2,3,4], where 0 is the lowest level, turning off all warnings.

2. What is the mcs option to turn off informational warnings?
mcs -warn:1

3. Rewrite this piece of code, x=(a>b?a:b), using the if statement.
if(a>b){x=a;}
else{x=b;}

4. If you need mathematical functions from, say, cmath.dll library, how do you link your program with the library?
In the Makefile, have a main executeable, where both the actual main file, and also the library is referenced:
»
main.exe : main.cs cmath.dll
	mcs -out:main.exe -reference:cmath.dll $<
«

5. What will the following piece of code print?
»
int i=0;
Write("{0}\n",i);
Write("{0}\n",i++);
Write("{0}\n",++i);
«

This will print:
»
0
0
2
«
Since the first Write is the initial value, 0. The second Write prints the value, 0, then adds 1 to it, so i=1. The last Write adds 1 to i, so i=2, THEN prints it.

6. Rewrite the loop while(condition)body using the for loop.
for(init;condition;increment){body;}

7. Rewrite the loop for(init;cond;inc)body using the while loop.
var i = init;
while(condition){body; increment;}

8. Rewrite the loop do body while(condition); using the for loop.
body; 
for(init; condition; increment){body;}
The do-while loop always evaluates at least 1 time, since the boolean is evaluated AFTER the loop.
